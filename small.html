  <!--Exercise 3-->
  
  <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
  <p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
    <li>That's about it</li>
    <li>I'm gonna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
    <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your items</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
  </ol>
